# Browser: It is a single instance of a web browser.
# Context: It is an isolated incognito-alike session within a browser instance. One browser may have multiple browser contexts. The recommended practice is for all tests to share one browser instance but for each test to have its own browser context.
# Page: It is a single tab or window within a browser context. A browser context may have multiple pages. Typically, an individual test should interact with only one page.
